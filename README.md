# 👋 Hi, I'm Philipp Tandler

I'm an environmental scientist with a strong background in data analysis, geospatial tools, and ecological systems. I’m passionate about using science and programming to create value for nature, people, and the planet.

My academic foundation is in **ecology, atmospheric science, and glaciology**, and I enjoy bridging environmental questions with robust data workflows. I believe in clear, efficient, and reproducible science — and I’m fascinated by the natural world.

## 🌿 What I do

- 🛰 **Remote sensing** and spatial data processing (Sentinel, Landsat, terrain models)
- 🗺 **GIS analysis** (raster, vector, projections, map algebra)
- 🧠 **Data pipelines** in `R`, `Python`, and `Bash`, especially for research and reproducible science
- 📊 **Statistical analysis** and visualization for ecological and environmental data
- ❄️ Experience with **HPC clusters**, climate and glacial datasets, and field-linked environmental models

## 🎓 Academic background

- **MSc in Environmental Sciences** – major: *Ecology and Evolution*, minor: *Physical Glaciology*
- **BSc in Environmental Sciences** – focus on *Atmospheric Sciences*
- Thesis work involving spatial data, ecological modeling, and applied programming

## 🛠 Tools & Languages

`R`, `Python`, `terra`, `QGIS`, `ArcGIS`, `bash`, `HPC/SLURM`, `git`

## 📁 Selected Projects

### 🌱 Arctic Vegetation Dynamics

> A dynamic Bayesian modeling pipeline to analyze shifts in Arctic plant community composition using species co-occurrence and environmental drivers.  
> - Multivariate dynamical model fitting using the `gjam` package  
> - Focused on ecosystem stability (resistance and resilience)
> - Developed a generalized framework to fit a dynamical model to a timeseries spatial raster data

### 🌾 Wetland Classification and Modeling

> Developed a spatial workflow to classify wetland types using multi-season Sentinel-2 imagery and terrain indices.  
> - Applied Random Forest classification with spatial cross-validation  
> - Implemented in R using `terra`, `mlr3`, and custom preprocessing  
> - Built for ecological monitoring and decision-support in a restoration context

## 💡 I'm interested in...

- Environmental research and data analysis projects
- Remote sensing and geospatial science for conservation, biodiversity, or climate adaptation
- Interdisciplinary work that combines **science, fieldwork, and data**
- Opportunities to contribute to impactful projects — academic or applied

I’m currently based in Canada (Swiss citizen) and open to remote or international collaboration.
